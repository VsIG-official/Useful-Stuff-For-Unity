    - Tips
        - Make Subscriptions in **Awake** method and everything else - in **Start**. This way You can avoid problem, when event has been called, but without subscribers
        - P.S. Yet I recommend to use *Unity Events* instead of *C# events*, 'cause You don't need to write **OnDestroy** method and there won't be any null checks
- Scene Managment
